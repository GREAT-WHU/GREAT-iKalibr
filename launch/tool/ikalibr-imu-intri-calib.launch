    <!-- this program perform static intrinsic calibration for a single IMU -->
    <!--
         the following parameters would be considered in the calibration:
         (1) the scale and non-orthogonal factor (matrix) of accelerator;
         (2) biases of accelerator and gyroscope;
         attention: for static intrinsic calibration, the scale and non-orthogonal factor (matrix) of gyroscope
         are lacking observability (for low-cost MEMS IMUs, which almost can not aware the earth rotation)
    -->
    <!-- multiple data pieces are required, they are collected stationary using different placement patterns -->
    <!-- for example, collect data using the same pattern  as the six-position calibration -->
    <!-- more details, please see the configure file at $(find ikalibr)/config/tool/config-imu-intri-calib.yaml -->
